## ðŸš€ Features

- Allow users to `register` storing passwords as hashes using the [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) library and verifying credentials before adding to database 
- Verify users to `login` by comparing hashes using [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)
  - Then create [JWT's](https://jwt.io/) used to `protect` certain API routes for their session
- `Simple search bar` that searches products looking for characters that are included in the product name
- Users can `add items` to their cart in which the icon will update dynamically to render how many items are currently in their cart
- Allow users to `update the quantity of a specific item` through the users cart
- Users can `delete items` from their cart in which the cart icon will also update dynamically
- `Checkout` with stripe
- Allow users to `view` their `orders` after checkout

## ðŸ’» How the API works 
#### A `Protected` route means a [JWT](https://jwt.io/) is used in a middleware to authorize the users actions
